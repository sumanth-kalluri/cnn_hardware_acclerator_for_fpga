# cnn_hardware_acclerator_for_fpga
This is a fully parameterized verilog implementation of computation kernels for accleration of the Inference of Convolutional Neural Networks on FPGAs

## Target device: Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA
## Software Tools : 
Design - Xilinx Vivado 2017

Verification - Python 3.6 for scripting and Xilinx ISE 14.7 command line tools.

## A very detailed explanation of the code and motivation behind this project has been written at [https://thedatabus.io/introduction](https://thedatabus.io/introduction). The updated code has also been moved to the site repository.
